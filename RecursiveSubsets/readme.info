     *  Description:                                                      *
     *                                                                    *
     *  Recursive C++ program that will output all the subsets of 		  *
     *  a set of n elements without repeating any subsets.                *
     *                                                                    *
     *                                                                    *
     *  The algorithm takes advantage of a recusrive call with a loop     *
     *  inisde of the algorithm. Additional helper methods are under      *
     *  the Utilities namespace.                                          *
     *                                                                    *
     *  Using a single method findSubsets, all subsets are taken into     *
     *  account where the variations method will initiate the findSubsets *
     *  method. findSubsets does all of the heavy lifting passing only    *
     *  index as a parameter that is updated at each call. variations     *
     *  method will prime this recursive function.                        *
     *                                                                    *
     *  I initially designed this algorithm to take into account all      *
     *  variations by statistical and probable definition that does not   *
     *  take into consideration the order of the subsets (variation       *
     *  without repitition), however that proved to be far too complex    *
     *  with a worst-case runtime complexity that would be in the order   *
     *  n*n!, with 5 inputs yielding in 600 outcomes alone.               *
     *                                                                    *
     *  The final version of this program avoids repition, but takes      *
     *  order of the set into consideration and does not reorder the set  *
     *  into however many possible ways representing set theory and       *
     *  proper sets rather than permutation, combination, or variation.   *
     *  All variables are handled or copied in at the class level.        *
     *                                                                    *
     *  Final worst-case runtimes are in the O(2^n) complexity. Due to    *
     *  this, test cases have been limited to only set lengths of 5 or    *
     *  less inputs. This is a far simpler scenario than the one          *
     *  originally imagined.                                              *
     *                                                                    *
     *  Exceptions are handled.                                           *
     *                                                                    *
